# belly-button-challenge
This is the repository for the Belly Button Biodiversity study that was used as the basis for developing interactive visualizations.   A json file containing the metadata for the individuals whose samples were used as the basis for this study.  This data was extracted using VS Code and put into a locally hosted website that showed the results of each person's sample.

Much of the code was starter code provided by the professor.  There was a lot of code that was resolved in office hours.  Though I worked on my own to try and sort it out, I could not get the code to work.  It wasn't until I was given the solution in office hours that I was able to work out what needed to happen to make the code function.
